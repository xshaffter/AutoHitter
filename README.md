# AutoHit Manager
Hollow Knight AutoHitter Count manager mod

### settings
- all the settings will be found in [My Documents]/AutoHit/.
- settings.json has variables to custom your way into the AutoHitMod (in a simple way by the moment).
1. "MaxVisibleSplits" manages the maximum amount of splits that may be visible in the widget at the same time.
2. "FuryTime": you may ignore this by the moment, deprecated (removed soon).
3. "splits" is the manager for your splits (this may be changed in a while), here you can place your split names as a quotation marked text, such as "Hornet".
### controls
- F1: Previous split
- F2: Next split
- F3: Mark last run as PB (you may need to end the run and go back to mark it). 
- All this controls can be changed in "AutoHitMod.GlobalSettings.json" found in your Hollow knight saves folder
